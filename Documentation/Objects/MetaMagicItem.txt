MetaMagic Item:
===============
Used to attach extra data to magic items, post-modify magicka cost, and provide visible feedback in the UI
Add a hardcoded type for each new MagicItem property that should affect magicka cost or be shown in menu.

+   Name
+   Icon
+   FLAG: ShowInMenu:
    +   FLAG: ShowName (if false, name appears when mouseover icon)
+   StacksWith: list of other MetaMagic items that can appear on the same line as this item
+   Display Callback - set name, icon, etc. before item is rendered.  called once for each metamagic item when 
                        popout is first attached to a magic item.

+   FLAG: ForSpellmaking, ForEnchanting, ForAlchemy: useable in respective in-game menus

+   FLAG: AdjustCost (for efficiency)
+   Cost MultBase, MultMult: new cost = old cost * (MultBase + MultMult*param), use param=0 if no param
+   GetCost Callback: used to override magicka cost calc
+   SetCost Callback: used to override inverse magicka cost calc

+   FLAG: HasParam - magic item can set a param for this metamagic, similar to weights with magic groups

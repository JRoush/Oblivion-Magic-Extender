Active Effect:
==============
-   State Info:
    -   Time Elapsed
    -   Magnitude
    -   Duration
    -   Hit Effects
    -   Type-specific info necessary to remove, and (as much as possible) to apply and update
        This data is not stored by default; apparently under the assumption that it can be fetched from the source effect/item
        as needed.  Source items can be changed by mod alteration or scripts; so AEs need to be reasonably autonomous once created.
        Most AEs can be extended to hold extra data, but parent classes (ActiveEffect, ModAVEffect, CommandEffect, SummonEffect) can't do so without
        breaking the game's code for their children.  For these parent classes, extra data must be attached in some other way.
        Possibility: Patch the apparently unused virtual function at 0x30 to return a pointer to extra data at the end of the object
-   State Flags:
    -   Applied: after call to ApplyEFfect() virtual method
    -   Terminated: effect is scheduled for removal
        - possible RSH extension - additional values to signal that effect is not to be destroyed, just suspended
    -   Removed: after call to RemoveEffect() virtual method
    -   Flags: seems likely that most bits are unused.  May be possible to use top word as an index into a seperate array of extra data.
-   Source:
    -   Magic Item
    -   Magic Type: cached for some reason
    -   Effect Item
    -   Caster
    -   Bound Object
    -   Type Code (RSH): i.e. handler code.  necessary b/c its possible for effects to change handlers  Needs extra-data storage.
-   Target:
    -   Target
-   Unkown:
    -   Unk2C
    
New Mechanics:
==============
-	When an active effect is replaced by a newer, equivalent, effect then some fraction of lost magicka is "reclaimed" & applied to new effect.
-   Allow a new 'suspendeded' states for AEs.  When in these states the actual effects of the AE are not applied, but it's timer continues to increment.  
    Useful for 'intervention' type reversible dispels and strongest-effect-only stacking behavior.  
    NOTE - The object (script or stacking group, etc.) that suspends an AE may mark it as "owned".  Such active effects should only be unsuspended by 
    the owner.  This prevents e.g. two stacking groups "fighting" over the state of an active effect that is in both.
    
Changes to Source objects while Active Effect exists:
=====================================================
Changes to state of caster, magic item, effect item, and effect setting fall into four categories:
-   Independent: property is duplicated and stored seperately on Active Effect, changes to or deletion of source have no effect
    This includes all properties that are used only once, at the moment the AE is created.
    -   Magnitude
    -   Duration
-   Ignored: property is not used by Active Effects at all.  
    This includes things like casting FX, projectile properties, etc.
-   Atomic use: property is used once at some later point in the AE lifecycle, or successive uses don't assume a consistent value
    These properties can be 'safely' changed and will be reflected immediately by AE
    -   Caster death: tracked by some handlers
    -   Most other properties - names, flags, costs, etc.
-   Integral: property is referenced multiple times by AE, and *assumed to be constant* inbetween
    Changes to these properties will cause the universe to implode
    Ideally, everything on this list should be moved to the 'Independent' category somehow
    -   Source handler (see file format notes)
    -   Effect Item index in Magic item (see file format notes) - this can't be fixed directly
    -   Source Effect Setting (see file format notes)
    -   'Recovers' flag
    -   Magic item type (for ModAV effects on abilities)
    -   Handler specific properties: Detrimental flag, etc.     
    
File Format Notes:
==================
-   Vanilla Loading:
    -   Load base active effect data & resolve magic item formID & effect item index
        If formID or index is bad, discard ActiveEffect record
    -   Determine source effect item, create appropriate ActiveEffect
        If creation fails, CTD (investigate)
    -   Use virtual methods of created active effect to finish loading
    -   Call link & postlink (after all AEs loaded?)
-   OBME loading:
    -   Check for auxiliary record (disguised as a dummy AE record).
        If found:
        -   Load handler code & create appropriate ActiveEffect
        -   Load base active effect data, and efit special index
        -   Resolve magic item formID & effect item index into pointers
            If resolution fails, or effect item has no EffectSetting (because it's from a removed mod):
                -   If AE record contains enough info to safely remove, add to target and flag for removal
                -   Otherwise, simply drop active effect
    -   Use virtual methods of created ActiveEffect to finish loading
    -   Call link & postlink, after all AEs loaded
-   OBME saving:
    -   Save an auziliary record containing handler code, mgefCode, special efit index, OBME version, & other extra data
        Savegame tracks number of active effects on each target, need to adjust accordingly
    -   Save active effect as in vanilla
-	AEs refer to their source by MagicItem formID and EffectItem index.  This index may change if EffectItems are dropped during loading,
    so ActiveEffects are easily corrupted by missing EffectSettings.  Have to Save mgefCode of source item and the index of the item 
    *among items with that code*.  That is, if the magic item has an SEFF, and FIDG, and then another SEFF, the three ActiveEffects 
    should store {SEFF,0}, {FIDG,0}, {SEFF,1}, respectively.  
    This hinges on the fact that either all effect items with that mgef are invalid, or none are.
-   Active effects don't store their type.  So if handler changes to something incompatible with saved record - disaster.  Have to save 
    handler code in auxiliary data.
    
Indiv. Active Effects:
======================
-   ApplyMagicItem:
    -   applies the specified item to the target, scaling magnitudes by master effect magnitude
    -   ParamA: magic item formID
    -   FlagB will be set if efitParam is used, in which case mgefParam may contain a leveled list of valid choices.
    -   useful for effects that combine two other effects (like the elemental shields), or effects that take advantage of the metamagic
        available to magic items (like selective targeting, chaining, etc).
    -   Flags C & D determine application type:
        -   Hidden: a single 'master' Active Effect is created, which creates & internally tracks the individual active effects from the item
                    duration of master effect is used instead of individual effect item durations
        -   Simple: the item is applied as though it had just be cast by the caster, with resistance checks & AI notifications, etc.
                    master effect creates no ActiveEffects & ActiveEffects from item are not tied to original spell at all
        -   Expanded: master effect is replaced by item's effects in local temporary magic item.       
    -   Aura:
        -   applies magic item exactly once to all targets in range, and any that enter range
        -   use master effect magnitude as range? can't scale magic item effects
            perhaps use efitParam as range? requires new hooks into magicka cost & qualified name calculation
            Param: an AV to track total effective range, a la Detect Life?
        -   cannot use 'Hidden' application type
        -   use *time remaining* on master effect rather than duration of individual effect items            
        -   implementation 1 - collision trigger planes
            implementation 2 - scan nearby targets every frame
        -   'Recovers' flag indicates that aura item should be dispelled from affected targets when they leave the aura's range or the aura
            itself is removed.  requires tracking of all affected targets
+   ScriptEffect:
    +   Executes an Magic Effect Script, using the ScriptEffectStart, ScriptEffectUpdate, & ScriptEffectFinish blocks
    +   Script comes from EffectSetting by default, or EffectItem::ScriptInfo if present (no override flag for the SCIT script, just check if it's present)
    +   Flag to determine if 'ScriptEffectAlwaysApplies' behavior affects this EffectSetting
    +   A resolution type for the EffectItem::ActorValue field, so that it can be resolved by script authors.
        Deprecated (since it involves script authors using the ActorValue field for something other than it's intended purpose), but supported for compatibility
    +   A new user parameter, with resolution type & value, stored on the EffectSetting and optionally overriden on the EffectItem.    
    -   NOTE: there is a bug in the execution of scripts, where an effect script active on a summoned creature is stripped of it's variables if the 
        player changes cells.  The variables are actually gone - not just reset to zero once, but every frame.  This may be only for magic effect
        scripts, only for scripts not on the player, only for scripts on summoned objects (which are temporary references?), or some combination
        of the three. This needs testing, and fixing if possible.
    -   NOTE: additional reported bugs with ScriptEffect include the Finish and/or Update blocks never firing.
+   AssociatedItemEffect:    
	+	References a base form, e.g. for summoning
    +	SummonCreatureEffect:
        +   Creates a temporary ref to the summoned actor, sets it's AI package to allied with target, & places in vicinity
        +	(RSH): if assoc item is a leveled list, scale 'level' with magnitude.
        +	(RSH): (possibly) scale level with magnitude.  use leveled lists in inventory and spell list to scale weapons, spells, and bonuses
        +   (RSH): make allying with target optional    
        +   SummonCreatureTargeted(RSH):
            +   summons a creature for the *caster*, but places in vicinity of target.  
            +   (possibly) have AI allied w/ caster, or selectively hostile to target, both, neither, etc.
	+	BoundItemEffect:
        +   Adds a copy of the associated weapon or armor to the target's inventory, forces them to equip it, and doesn't allow them to remove it
        +	(RSH): if assoc item is a leveled list, scale 'level' with magnitude.
		+   (RSH): make force equip / no unequip optional - needs research
    +   SummonInventoryItem(RSH):
        +   Same as BoundItem, but for arbitrary inventory items.
        +   Doesn't automatically activate -  Hinges on possibility of tracking a particular inventory ref, and/or preventing the target from dropping the item
-   Banish(RSH):
    -   if target is a summon, attempt to dispel the summon effect from the caster
        if target is an ordinary actor, attempt to dispel to all of the their summon effects
        otherwise, do nothing
+   ValueModifierEffect:
    +   modifies specified part of specified AV
    +   Magnitude is AV points or a (percentage, source modifier) to add/subtract (depending on Detrimental flag)
    +   AV is changed only once if recoverable flag is set and is restored when effect expires
        AV is changes every second if recoverable flag is not set
	+	Targets a specific modifier
    +   Bounds checking: base modifier cannot drop below zero for some select avs.
    +   Uses AV field of effect items if (!UsesAV || UsesAttribute || UseSkill) flag OR (AV field override) EfitHandler flag
        If AV field of effect item is used, AV field of mgef is the 'default' value
    +   UseAttribute & UseSkill flags used for spellmaking + enchanting menu
    +   Subtract effects may have an option to limit subtraction at the 0,1 point of the total av 
        If limit is reached, alters magnitude for recoverable & terminates effect otherwise
    +	Absorb:
        +   All changes to target's AV's are mirrored but opposite on caster
        +   Effect terminates if distance between caster & target grows beyond set limit
        +   Percentage magnitudes are of target for detrimental, of caster for incremental
-   EnvironmentalDamage:
    -   Applies damage depending on environmental conditions of target location?
    -   Weather, time of day, etc?
    -	SunDamage:
-	Paralysis
-	Shield
    - Elemental Shields(DEP): replace with ApplyMagicItem
	- repurpose an unused AV for a static damage reduction, like armor in SC ?
-	Calm
-	Frenzy
-	Demoralize
-	CommandActor
    -   Temporarily modifies target AI to be allied with caster
    -	CommandCreature: replace w/ just CommandActor?
    -	CommandHumanoid: replace w/ just CommandActor?
-	Reanimate:
    -   Temporarily revives a corpse  & allies it with caster.
    -   Does this go under Summon, or Command?
-	TurnUndead: replace w/ plain old demoralize?  what's the difference?
-	Chameleon
-	Invisibility
-	Vampirism: depricate?  what does this do, exactly?
-	DetectLife:
    -   Applies an effect shader to living actors, magnitude is range
    -   scale shader intensity based on distance from target?
-   VisionShader(RSH)
    -   applies a shader to the vision of the target
    -   magnitude is strength of shader?
    -   Probably need to interface or depend on OBGE for this to work
    -   Param: identifier of shader to use, not sure how to do that just yet
    -	NightEye:
-	Light
    -   magnitude is strength of light.  
    -   ParamA: fromid of light to use
 -	Darkness
    -   same as light, more or less
+	Dispel:
    +   Remove an active magic item if it's casting cost is compares favorably with the magnitude (VANILLA)
    +   hostile dispel targets only effects from beneficial items, beneficial dispel targets only efects from hostile items, neutral dispel targets everything.
    +   Target specification:
        +   Specific Effect Handler
            +   Specific Magic Effect
        +   Magic Item types (each independently), including enchantment subtypes
            +   Specific magic item
            +   LevelelSpell, for a list of spells
    +   Atomic MagicItem: Dispel acts on all active effects from a single magic item, as opposed to active effects individually.  Acts as a modifier to the
        behavior of the Atomic Dispel and Distribute Magnitude options.
    +   Atmoic Dispel: Dispel either removes completely or doesn't change.  Otherwise, dispel reduces effective magicka cost of each targeted object.
        If an effect has a duration, that is reduced.  If an effect has no duration (e.g. persistent) it's magnitude is reduced.  If an effect has neither
        duration nor magnitude then it is immutably Atomic.        
        NOTE: some effects parse & use their magnitudes only once.  If magnitude must be changed, need to remove and re-apply effect.
    +   Distribute Magnitude:  Magnitude is partitioned equally among all targetable objects.  If a particular object is removed completely without 'using' 
        all of it's alloted potion, then the remainder is distributed among the remaining objects.  Otherwise, each targetable object gets the entire magnitude, 
        all independently of each other.
    +   Dispel effects with 'No Magnitude' effectively have infinite magnitude - they dispel all targeted objects.
    +   Optionally, use the casting cost (actual magicka paid by caster) rather than effective magicka cost
        May need additional flag to use this option only for OnSelf effects, in order to reproduce vanilla behavior
    +   Cure(DEP) - deprecate in favor of Dispel
-   ModifyInventoryItems(RSH):
    -   with the introduction of inventory-walking functions in obse v19, new effects in this vein are more straightforward to do with
        the script effect handler.
    -	DisintegrateArmor:
    -	DisintegrateWeapon:
-	Lock
    -   lock locks with difficulty == magnitude
-	Open
    -   unlock locks up to magnitude in difficulty.
-	SoulTrap: 
        -   refill caster's soulgems.  Combine deathevent with ModifyInventoryItems
-	Telekinesis:
    -   allow remote activation on certain objects (nonloading doors, containers, locks, etc)?
        is it possible to grab acotrs or other animated objects?
    - 	if nothing held, targeted item is grabbed & pulled in at exponential speed to normal activating range
        if something is held, recasting thows the item w/ force proportional to magnitude of spell
        Do ballistic objects to damage?  SOme mods implement this, may be a good addition to the physics system
-   Shockwave(RSH)
-   TimeSlow(RSH)
-   SetWeather(RSH)
    -   ParamA is formID of weather to set to
    -   ParamB is time of day?
-   Teleportation(RSH)
    -   transport target to specified location
        Vanilla dungeons and worldspaces were designed under the assumption that the player could only move on foot or by swimming.
        Short distance teleportation will break some dungeon puzzles & make things like long narrow ledges much less dangerous.
        This is done by other mods, though, and is not too serious.  Long distance teleports will allow player to leave restricted 
        areas like M.Cameron's paradise or Jail & return at will.  This is very serious, and means that teleport effects *should*
        have restrictions on crossing cell boundaries (like leaving a dungeon) and respect fast travel rules.  
        For best effect, try to follow game's pathing routines (whatever it uses to lay out red quest
        markers) to plot path to objective.
    -   magnitude is maximum distance.  
    -   Param: destination marker
    -   Flag: use current crosshairs/combat target as destination
    -   Flags: respect of fast-travel rules, crossing cell boundaries, etc.
-   Nullgrav(RSH)

Results:
------------------
-   Spell Disabled (once, cannot begin casting)
        spell is in cooldown
        Silence 
        current magicka < actual cost 
        magicka factor > 1 (DEP)

        staggered
        knocked
        paralyzed
-   Overcasting (cumulative, apply overcasting effects increasing (exponentially?))
        casting fraction * magicka factor > 1
-   Spell Potency (once, modify effective magicka of post-cast spell)
        cumulative transforming fraction (penalty for long transformations)
        effectiveness
        cumulative casting fraction * actual cost (charging powers up spell)
        cumulative casting fraction (bonus for long charging periods)
-   Spell Application (once, modify effective magicka of spell when applied to target)
        reflection, absorption, resistance, penetration
        detection (sneak attack bonus for hostile spells)  
-   Experience (once)
        const (DEP)
        base cost * casting fraction (RSH)
        apply modifiers if same spell was just cast
-   Cooldown (once)
        only for greater powers (DEP)
-   'Overcasting' Penalties        
    -   Stop running
    -   Unsneak
    -   Extra experience
    -   Effects taken from a levelled spell list and scaled exponentially by overcasting ratio
        Scaling should be such that a spell at ~150% cutoff is a once-a-day,use-all-your-potions-to-recover 
        ordeal, and a spell at ~200% cutoff is instant death to the caster.
        -   Damage to Skills & Attributes
        -   Damage to Health, Fatigue, Magicka
        -   Impairment (paralysis, silence, stunted magicka)
        -   Damage to effectiveness, efficiency, magicka scale
        
Projectile:
-----------------
    -   Once spawned, tracks distance traveled.  Apply changes to path for homing/gravity/reflection/etc.
        Dimninish effect strength as distance increases, and (?) reduce size to provide feedback
        When intensity reaches zero, display a 'fizzle' FX - projectile implioding or something
            
Continuous casting:
===================
-	Split casting action into 4 stages : 
    -	Warmup (Cast button down, once started whole stage must complete)
        -   Check Spell Disabled 
        -   apply Fatigue & Misc Requirements lost
        -	Caster animation (e.g. arm brought to chest) & spell VFX
        -	apply Magicka Lost, check Spell Failure, check Overcasting
    -	Charge/Transformation (Warmup completed)
        -   Charging (charging is enabled && cast button held down)
            -	apply Magicka Lost, check Spell Failure, check Overcasting, apply new spell stats
        -   Transforming (transformation is enabled && transformation in progress)
            -   apply new spell stats, trading magicka at a fixed rate (~ 100% magicka tradeoff over one casting length?)
        -	No caster animation, extend spell charging VFX ?  
        -   Charging and Transforming may be done concurrently
    -	Cast (Charge completed, once started whole stage must complete)
        -	flag for repeat if (recasting enabled && cast button held down)
        -	Caster animation (e.g. arm thrown out), first time only
            same time frame as caster animation, even if it's not played
        -   apply Spell Potency
        -   apply Experience
        -	create & launch projectile or apply effects to target if no projectile
        -   if flagged for repeat:
            -   Check Spell Disabled 
            -   apply Fatigue & Misc Requirements lost
            -	Caster animation (e.g. arm brought to chest) & spell VFX
            -	apply Magicka Lost, check Spell Failure, check Overcasting
    -	Cooldown:
        -   apply Cooldown
        -   clear any overrides, temp spells, etc.
        -	Caster animation (e.g. arm returned to side), animation may vary if actor is blocking
-	Once released, the cast button can't be pressed again until the Cooldown stage is completed
-	player has until end of warmup stage to release cast button for a 'normal' (no charging/recasting) cycle	


Player Casting Controls:
========================
-	HUD element for current MagicItem:
	-	Mag/Dur/Area/Range/Etc meters (hide if unused)
	-	Magicka penalty meter: shows seriousness of side effects being applied (hide for non-spells)
-   use block button to enable charging / recasting
-   use a 'transform' key to enable spell tranforms:
    - trade magnitude for duration  & visa versa
    - trade magnitude for area  & visa versa
    - switch between self/touch & touch/target (trade magnitude)
    - trade magnitude for penetration, possibly for other meta magic properties
-   HUD targeting indicator, for Telekenesis-like targeting
    Don't use targeting cursor or display name/weight/etc. for activatable objects like telekinsis
    Useful for feedback on projectile range, and for selecting targets for homing projectiles

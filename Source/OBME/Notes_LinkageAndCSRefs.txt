All methods should treate forms as implicitly linked, and should not attempt to manage CS cross references.
Special cases:
    -   Link() & Unlink(): these excplicitly set the linkage state and manage refs.
    -   CopyFrom(): explicitly manages refs; assumes linkage is valid
    -   Destructor (Forms only): clear refs, for consistency with vanilla behavior
The constructor & destructor are *not* exceptions.  Objects should be constructed fully linked, but not cross ref'd.

Object lifecycle:
------------------

-   DataHandler Initialized:
    -   All refs cleared
    -   Creation of builtin objects, in order of precedence
    -   Unlink + Link builtin objects, to correct refs

-   Objects loaded from disk:
    -   Unlink (clear refs/links for builtin objects)
    -   Loading from disk, unlinked
    -   Link
    
-   Objects created:
    -   New form constructed
    -   Unlink + Link form, to correct refs
    -   Add form to data handler
    
-   Objects edited in dialog (CS only):
    -   Temp copy created
    -   Temp copy altered - refs not managed
    -   Base object copied from temp
    -   Temp destroyed

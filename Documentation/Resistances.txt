Magic Resistances
=================
-   AlwaysApplies = (SEFF from magic item w/ SEFFAlwaysApplies) || (Spell\Power\LesserPower cast by Player on Self)
-   Abilities & Diseases & (Effects w/ AlwaysApplies) always have resistance factor 1.0
-   For Actor targets:
    -   Edible Ingredients, wearable enchantments, and Magic Items w/ no hostile effects are immune to resistances
    -   If magic item resistAV == effect item resistAV, then just use one : (1 - EffectResistance)
    -   Otherwise, product of (1 - ResistMagic/ResistPoison) * (1 - EffectResistance)
-   Resistance Factor is never applied to ingredient effects
-   Resist Disease is apparently applied during disease transfer, not on application

-   Resistance applies *after* spell absorb/reflect, bit it *does* apply.

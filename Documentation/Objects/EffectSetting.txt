Effect Setting:
===============
+	General:
	+	FormID - some default effects have no formID, but exist as objects in memory nonetheless.
                 All effects, even those with no formID, must have valid form data, including an OverrideList.
    +   EditorID -  identical to the effect code for vanilla effects.  Need to decouple, make it an ordinary editor id.
                    Requires changing file format.  Script functions that take 'magiceffect:chars' actually take the editor id
	+	EffectCode -
            -   0x00000000: None.  Default value.
            -   0x000000001 - 0x7FFFFFFF: Static code.  Set by mod creator and always read literally.  Must be unique across all mods.
            -   0x800000000 - 0xFFFFFFFE: Dynamic code. Set by obme on request, lowest byte is resolved like highest byte of formid on load
                                            Since effect codes may be stored in script variables, a function must be provided for scripters
                                            to resolve a stored code properly.
            -   0xFFFFFFFF: Invalid code.
    -	FLAGS:  Disabled -  Effect is ignored in aggregate qualities of magic items (magicka, hostility, school, mastery, etc.)
                            Vanilla behavior also disables spell casting (DEP). 
    -	FLAGS:  Spellmaking,Enchanting,NoIngredients
    -   FLAGS:  NoRecast - what does this do?        
	-	FLAGS:  UnknownF  - what does this do?  
	-	FLAGS:  UnknownO - Probably a "Meta" effect flag already in use, perhaps a 'NoRange' flag
    
+   School:    
	+	School - school code (formID, for extended schools)

	+	CounterEffects - list of mgefCodes that remove or counteract this effect.  used by the AI?
    
+	Hostility:
	+	FLAGS:	Hostile - effects that would only be used on an enemy. Has strong impacts in alchemy & the game's ai system
	+	FLAGS: 	Beneficial(RSH) - effects that would only be used on an ally.  ignored if hostile bit is set

    +   Dispel Factor(RSH) - multiplies default dispelling factor (which is set by a game setting)    
+	Duration:
    +	FLAGS:	NoDuration

	+	FLAGS: ProjectileType (2 bits) - {00 = Ball, 01 = Spray, 10 = Bolt, 11 = Fog}
	+	ProjectileSpeed - multiplies speed of projectile (RSH): negative for infinite speed, e.g. action-at-a-distance    
    +	FLAGS:  Projectile Explodes With Force - use havok for projectile explosion

+   EffectHandler:
	+	FLAGS:  Recoverable - effects reversed upon expiration, generally true for everything but damage & restore effects    
    +   EffectHandler(RSH) - pointer to EffectHandler structure that stores handler specific data and manages menus
	+	Vanilla Fields:
        Continue to use these fields for their original purpose; all other handler-specific data is stored in the attached handler object
		+	AssociatedItemEffect Handler:
			+	MgefParam: AssociatedItem formID
			+	FLAGS: UseWeapon, UseArmor, UseCreature

File Format Notes:
==================
-	unrecognized EffectSettings are safely ignored
-	Don't repurpose existing fields.  Add new fields, and new chunks.
        
New Effects:
============
-	Shits & Giggles: 
	-   Inebriation: fuzzy vision shader & unresponsive controls for player, special AI for actors
	
-	Weather:	work only out of doors, perhaps require a minimum area?
	-	Meteorloogy: switches selected to weather type, allow overrides on an effect item basis

-	Cheat Death:
	-	Intervention:	Trap on-death event & return player to last "safe" location
	
-	Teleportation: perhaps more suitable as single spells rather than general effects - although the max range component is very fundamental
	-	Assassin Rush:	max range, pulls player behind targeted object or in indicated direction
	-	Blink:	max range, teleports player to line-of-sight destination
	
-	Summon Rideable:
	Following Bethesda's lead, probably shouldn't implement any summons for creatures that don't occur naturally in the game.
	But, other than imps,butterflies, and that dragon at the end, there are no flying enemies in the game.  I suppose if there were,
	all the players who chose melee combat would end up feeling a bit silly.
	-	Summon Pony
	-	Summon Horse
	-	Summon Pegasus: flys
	-	Summon Unicorn: feedable, a la tiger from Midas Magic?  it's the *same* unicorn every time
	-	Summon Dragon: flys
	-	Summon Flying Carpet: flys, inanimate (invincible, doesn't attack, etc.)
    
-   Inventory:
    Bound Arrows - add arrows to inventory
    Disarm - unequip (force to drop?) current weapon

-	Summon:
	-	Summon Baelrog:	permanent until killed, hostile to *everything* - must be charmed or commanded
	-	Banish:	does damage proportional to magnitude to summoned creatures.  
				if target isn't summoned, but has a summon(s) then they are targeted instead
-	Modify AV:		
	-	Acid Damage: does direct 'poison' damage to health, and to one or more random attributes
	-	Blindness: increases actors 'blindness' stat

	-	Deathsight:	corpses
	-	Perception:	live actors, showing detection level
	-	Threat:	live actors, showing relative level + confidence

	-	Chain Lightening: chain on hit, shock damage
	
-	Physics:
	-	Barrier:	collision surface that blocks pathing, and slows movement, projectile speed (not magic)

	-	Time Slow:	slow projectiles, actors, animations, everything but caster inside area of affect
	-	Nullgravity:	target is unaffected by gravity or friction (if that's even possible)
                        use to levitate self or target, possibly combine w/ shockwave to levitate self and scoot around

Selective Targeting:
====================
+   Target a specific formID:
    +   specific REFR
    +   base object form
    +   LL of base object forms
+   Callback script: called to evaluate potential targets, returns a float [0.0,1.0] indicating how 'valid' the target is
    effect is scaled before application based on return value, a la resistance
+   Target a specific hostility, relative to caster:
    Beneficial  - hit only allied targets, and neutral targets as well (why not?)
    Hostile     - hit only hostile targets
    All         - hit all targets (default)
